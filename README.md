# EMU Script
An electronic music script editor and MIDI sequencer for MacOS.

EMU-Script is not a DAW. It proposes a different approach to electronic music creation:
- Programmable multi-track MIDI sequencer.
- Music sheet viewer that automatically scrolls during playback.
- Built-in script editor with syntax highlighting and error checking.
- Control your virtual instruments and external synthesizer using MIDI messages (MIDI note, control change, and program change).
- Structure your composition using musical sections and sequencing functions.
- Use chord progressions, strum chords, and play arpeggios.
- Specific notation for drum instruments.
- User-definable sounds (hard-coded MIDI note or sample file).

## Documentation
- The user manual can be found [here](https://github.com/sylvain-pearson/EMU-Script/Doc/User-Manual.md)
- The `Scripts` directory contains many examples of EMU scripts.

## Requirements
- Xcode version 26 or higher is required to build the application.
- Minimum required MacOS version: 26
- A synthesizer or virtual instrument (MIDI compatible; plugins are not supported).
- If you want to record your music creation, you need an audio mixing application.
